I've worked with functions in other languages before, so the scripting/logic elements of this module came somewhat easily. However, it served as good practice
for syncing with GitHub and getting the syntax of JavaScript down, and I felt more confident in that in comparison to the first module assignment.

Having a consolidated toolkit would be useful in the real world because it would streamline tasks, allowing access to prewritten portions of code for repetitive tasks
rather than having to rewrite or copy bits.
