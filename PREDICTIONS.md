I predict that the double() function will take a number and double its value.

I predict that the square() function will provide the square value of a number.

I predict that the isEven() function will confirm if a number is even.

I predict that the isOdd() function will confirm if a number is odd.

I predict that the multiply() function will accept two values and multiply them against each other.
